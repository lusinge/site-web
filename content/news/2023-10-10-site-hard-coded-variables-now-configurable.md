For those of you using our static site code for your own site, or following the
progress, this update is for you. We have recently updated the code to move all
hard-coded references specific to this site out to a configuration file where
possible. This means we will very soon be moving the repo and starting up a new
account solely for this sites software (so FLEAR can do what it was supposed to).

Please keep a close eye for our next status update, which hopefully will be to
announce the new repo and home for this project. In the meantime the code is
ready for more eyes.
