When contributing to this repository, it is usually a good idea to first discuss the change you
wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before
making a change. This could potentially save a lot of wasted hours.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development

### Testing

In order to perform tests identical in nature to the integration tests we run then simply ensure you gave gitlab-runner installed then run the following command.

```bash
gitlab-runner exec docker test
```

Keep in mind this will run the tests on your local copy of the master branch so any changes not committed locally will be missed when testing.

### Commit Message Format

All commits on the repository repository follow the
[Conventional Changelog standard](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-eslint/blob/master/convention.md).
It is a very simple format so you can still write commit messages by hand. However it is
recommended developers install [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/),
it extends the git command and will make writing commit messages a breeze.

Getting Commitizen installed is usually trivial, just install it via npm. You will also
need to install the cz-customizable adapter which the this repository is configured
to use. However the format is simple enough to use manually this makes it easier not to forget,
especially for developers not accustomed to the format yet.

```bash

npm install -g commitizen@2.8.6 cz-customizable@4.0.0
```

Below is an example of Commitizen in action. It replaces your usual `git commit` command
with `git cz` instead. The new command takes all the same arguments however it leads you
through an interactive process to generate the commit message.

Commit messages are used to automatically generate detailed changelogs, and to ensure
commits are searchable in a useful way. So please use the Commitizen tool or adhere to
the commit message standard or else we cannot accept Pull Requests without editing
them first.

Below is an example of a properly formated commit message.
